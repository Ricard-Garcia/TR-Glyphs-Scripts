# General

Python scripts made at [Typerepublic] (http://typerepublic.com) for  [Glyphs App](http://glyphsapp.com/) font editor.


# Setting-up

1. Put this folder into the *Scripts* folder inside the app. 
2. Go to the *Script* menu and *Reload Scripts*.
3. Install Tal Leming's *Vanilla* via *Glyphs > Preferences > Addons > Modules* (just because some scripts might need it).

### git

Using git is very convenient for this kind of files. Use this git command and clone this repository either in the *Scripts Folder* or somewhere in your computer using an alias inside Glyphs' *Scripts Folder*.

In your terminal change your directory to the place you want to clone the repository in your local machine and write:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ricard-Garcia/TR-Glyphs-Scripts.git
```

And use the pull command for updating it (while being inside the folder):

```bash
git pull

```

# Requirements

To run the scripts, please make sure you have a version of Glyphs App 2 (or later) as well as having macOS 10.9 or later.

As said previously, some scripts might need the module *Vanilla* for creating UI elements. Please, check how to install it above.


# Scripts

This group of scripts are the result of all the particular necessities we've encontoured at [Typerepublic] (http://typerepublic.com) while developing different kind of projects. Please note that this started as a unique set of tools for very particular tasks we had to do during the development of our projects. Some scripts might do very similar tasks that others' are already doing but still we found it worth enough to share them with whoever might find them interesting and handy.

## Testing

*Anchor Mover is for batch-processing anchor positions. Can be useful after adjusting the x-height. No-brainer: I always use the Repostion script on my combining marks, so stacking combining marks stays in the italic angle.*

* **Anchor Mover:**  no clipping will occur in Chrome.*

* **New Tab with Fraction Figure Combinations:** Opens an Edit tab with fraction figure combos for spacing and kerning.


# Possible problems

Check your app is up to date and you have the latest version of the script. For any other problem, please contact me at ```imricardgarcia@gmail.com```.
